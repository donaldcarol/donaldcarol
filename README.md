- ## 👋 Hi, I’m Donald

Senior Infrastructure & Cloud Engineer with strong focus on **Azure**, **Terraform**, and **DevOps automation**.  
I design, build, and operate **secure, scalable, and highly available** cloud and hybrid infrastructures.

---

### 🔧 What I work with
- **Cloud:** Microsoft Azure (IaaS, networking, identity), AWS (Terraform-based labs)
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Terraform (modules, state management, best practices)
- **DevOps:** Git, GitHub, CI/CD fundamentals, GitOps concepts
- **Operating Systems:** Windows Server (senior), Linux
- **Virtualization:** Hyper-V, VMware
- **Identity & Security:** Entra ID (Azure AD), RBAC, basic Zero Trust principles

---

### 🌱 Currently learning / improving
- Advanced **Terraform** patterns (modules, remote backends, multi-environment setups)
- **Multi-cloud** design (Azure + AWS)
- CI/CD pipelines for infrastructure (GitHub Actions / Azure DevOps)
- Cloud security and hardening best practices

---

### 🧪 Labs & repositories
Most repositories here are **hands-on labs** focused on:
- real-world infrastructure scenarios
- reproducible setups
- clean Git history (no secrets, no state files)

---
### 📂 Featured repositories

- 🔹 **Terraform Azure Lab**  
  https://github.com/donaldcarol/terraform-azure-lab01  
  Azure infrastructure lab using Terraform (networking, resource groups, best practices).

- 🔹 **Terraform AWS Lab**  
  https://github.com/donaldcarol/terraform-aws  
  AWS infrastructure experiments with Terraform, focusing on clean state management and security (no hardcoded secrets).

- 🔹 **DevOps Lab**  
  https://github.com/donaldcarol/devops-lab  
  Playground for DevOps concepts: Git workflows, IaC structure, and CI/CD experiments.



### 💡 How I work
- infrastructure as **code**, not click-ops
- security and availability **by design**
- simple, well-documented solutions over over-engineering
